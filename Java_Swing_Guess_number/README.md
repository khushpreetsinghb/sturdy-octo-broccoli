# Guess number game using Java Swing

The program is a number guessing game which generates a random number between 1 to 100 and asks the user to enter a number if the number entered is smaller or larger 
than the random number then you can enter the number again and it is shown that the number entered is smaller or larger according to the number you entered. You can 
restart by entering another number after guessing the first number by entering some number.
